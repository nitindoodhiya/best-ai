"What is the capital of France?"," The capital of France is Paris.  "
"What is the powerhouse of the cell?"," The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are responsible for generating most of the chemical energy within the cell in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell for various processes such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction. They do this through a process called cellular respiration.  "
"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?"," Shakespeare wrote 'Romeo and Juliet.' The play was first published in a quarto (a form of book) in 1597, but it is believed that the original version may have been written around 1591-92. It's one of his most famous works, often considered a classic in literature.  "
"What is the derivative of x^2?"," The derivative of a function gives us information about how that function changes as its input, or argument, changes. For functions involving powers like `x^2`, we can use power rules to find their derivatives. In this case, the power rule for differentiation states that if `f(x) = x^n` (where n is a constant), then the derivative of `f(x)` is given by:     `f'(x) = n*x^(n-1)`  So, for `x^2`, the derivative is:     `(2)*x^(2 - 1) = 2*x`.  Thus, the derivative of `x^2` is `2x`.  "
"What is the chemical symbol for water?"," The chemical symbol for water is H2O. This represents that water consists of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O).  "
"Who proposed the theory of relativity?"," The theory of relativity was proposed by Albert Einstein. He presented two parts to this theory: Special Relativity (1905) and General Relativity (1915).  "
"What is the largest planet in the solar system?"," The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. It's known for its Great Red Spot, a storm that has been raging on the planet for at least 300 years and possibly over 400 years. It is also the most massive planet in our solar system, accounting for about two-thirds of all the combined masses of all the other planets in our solar system!  "
"What is the square root of 144?"," The square root of 144 is 12. This means that if you multiply 12 by itself (12 * 12), you get 144, which confirms that 12 is indeed the square root of 144.  "
"In what year did World War II end?","1945, specifically on September 2, when Japan officially surrendered. However, if you're asking about the end of the European Theater, that was in 1945, May 7 or V-E Day (Victory in Europe).  "
"What programming language is known for its snake logo?"," The programming language that is commonly associated with the snake logo is Python. The snake logo represents a recursive function that draws a fractal and was designed by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, in 1989, before Python was created. However, Python adopted the snake logo as its own due to its flexibility, readability, and ease of use. The name 'Python' was chosen by the language's creator, Guido van Rossum, partly because he liked the Monty Python comedy group and partly because he wanted a name that was short, unique, and easy to spell.
