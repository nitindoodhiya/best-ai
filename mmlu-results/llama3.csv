"What is the capital of France?","The capital of France is Paris.  "
"What is the powerhouse of the cell?","The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria (plural: mitochondria). Mitochondria are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Their primary function is to generate energy for the cell through a process called cellular respiration.  Mitochondria convert the energy stored in glucose or other nutrients into a form that can be used by the cell, such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This process involves the breakdown of glucose molecules into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondria have their own DNA, known as mtDNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the cell's nucleus.  The term 'powerhouse' was coined because mitochondria are responsible for generating most of the energy needed by cells to perform their various functions, such as muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and maintenance of cellular structures. In essence, mitochondria are the batteries that power the cell!  "
"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?","Romeo and Juliet, a tragedy written by William Shakespeare.  "
"What is the derivative of x^2?","The derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x.  In general, if we have a function f(x) = x^n, where n is any real number, then its derivative is:  f'(x) = nx^(n-1)  So, in this case, since n=2, we get:  f'(x) = 2x^(2-1) = 2x  "
"What is the chemical symbol for water?","The chemical symbol for water is H2O.  "
"Who proposed the theory of relativity?","Albert Einstein proposed the theory of relativity. Specifically, he developed two main theories:  1. **Special Relativity** (1905): This theory posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other. It introduced the concept of time dilation, length contraction, and the famous equation E=mcÂ². 2. **General Relativity** (1915): This theory builds upon special relativity and introduces the concept of gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. It predicts phenomena such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the bending of light around massive bodies.  Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and it remains a cornerstone of modern physics and astronomy.  "
"What is the largest planet in the solar system?","The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. It is a gas giant, meaning it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. Jupiter has a diameter of approximately 142,984 kilometers (88,846 miles), which is more than 11 times larger than the Earth's diameter.  In fact, Jupiter is so massive that it is more than 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in our solar system combined! Its massive size and gravitational pull are responsible for some interesting features, such as its numerous moons (a total of 79 known moons orbiting Jupiter) and strong storm systems, including the famous Great Red Spot, which has been raging for centuries.  So there you have it - Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system!  "
"What is the square root of 144?","The square root of 144 is 12.  "
"In what year did World War II end?","World War II ended in 1945. The war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, with the formal surrender of Germany, known as V-E Day (Victory in Europe Day). The war in the Pacific ended on August 15, 1945, when Japan formally surrendered to the Allied Powers, marking the end of World War II.  "
"What programming language is known for its snake logo?","That would be Python! The official Python logo features a snake, and it's one of the most recognizable logos in the programming world.  "
