"What is the capital of France?","The capital city of France is Paris (French: 'Paris'). Some other major cities in France include Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse.  "
"What is the powerhouse of the cell?","The mitochondria are often referred to as the 'powerhouse' of the cell, as they are responsible for generating most of the cell's energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria contain their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from bacteria that were engulfed by other cells. As a result, they retain some bacterial characteristics, such as a unique circular genome and the ability to replicate independently. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic conditions.  "
"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?","William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. It is one of his most famous plays, commonly categorized as a tragic romance or a tragedy, and is part of the English literary canon. The play was first published in a quarto version in 1597, and its authorship has been attributed to Shakespeare since the early 20th century. However, there have been some scholars who have proposed alternative theories regarding its authorship, such as the 'Shakespearean thesis' and the 'Shake-Speares' theory, but these have largely been dismissed by mainstream scholarship.

"What is the derivative of x^2?","The derivative of a function represents its instantaneous rate of change. When we talk about finding the derivative of a function, we are actually finding an equation that describes how quickly the function is changing at any given point on the graph.  In this case, let's find the derivative of x^2, which is written as f(x) = x^2.   To find the derivative, we use the power rule: if n is a positive integer, then the derivative of x^n is n * x^(n-1). In this case, since n=2, the derivative is 2 * x^(2-1), which simplifies to 2x.  So, the equation that describes how quickly x^2 is changing at any given point on its graph is:  f'(x) = 2x  In other words, as x increases by a small amount, the value of f(x) will increase approximately twice as much as x itself. This can be helpful in many real-life applications, such as calculating how quickly a ball is slowing down as it falls due to gravity or how rapidly the population of an animal species is growing over time.

"What is the chemical symbol for water?","The chemical symbol for water is H2O. The word 'water' in chemistry refers to the molecule composed of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O), represented by the formula H2O. The chemical symbol for water, which consists of the first letter(s) of each element's name, is commonly used in scientific notation.  "
"Who proposed the theory of relativity?","Albert Einstein proposed the theory of relativity. Specifically, he presented two major theories: special relativity in 1905 and general relativity in 1915. Special relativity described the relationships between space and time for objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other, while general relativity explained how gravity affects the fabric of spacetime itself. Both theories fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe.  "
"What is the largest planet in the solar system?","The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. Its mass is about 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the solar system combined, and it has a diameter of approximately 142,984 kilometers (88,730 miles).  "
"What is the square root of 144?","The square root of 144 is 12, which means that 12 multiplied by itself is equal to 144. This can be expressed as:  √144 = 12  Another way to write this is:  144 = 12 * 12  The square root function (√) is the opposite of the square function (^2). The square root finds a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original number. In this case, 12 is the square root of 144 because 12 * 12 = 144.  "
"In what year did World War II end?","World War II ended in 1945. The surrender of Germany, following the defeat of its armed forces, occurred on May 7, 1945, signed on May 8 (known as V-E Day). Japan surrendered on August 14, 1945, signed on August 2 (known as V-J Day), marking the formal end of the war. However, some colonial wars and conflicts related to the aftermath of the war continued for several years afterward in places like Indonesia and China.  "
"What programming language is known for its snake logo?","The programming language Python is known for its snake logo. The logo features a stylized snake, made up of the first letter of the language's name (Py) and an 'thon' (meaning), curled around to form a loop. This logo was designed by Tim Peters in 1991, and it has become an iconic symbol for the Python community.  "
